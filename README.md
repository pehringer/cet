# ***map***
Are you looking for a versatile associative array for C? Look no further. This library offers a hash table that utilizes Robin Hood hashing, a technique that dynamically rearranges keys to keep them close to their ideal hash locations, resulting in a fast and reliable associative array.
- Easy to use (library only has eight functions)

# Example Code
# Library Functions
---
### ```Map* map_Init(const size_t key, const size_t val, const size_t cap)```
---
### ```void map_Free(Map *m)```
Frees map from memory.  
- ```m``` map returned by map_Init.
---
### ```size_t map_Cap(Map *m)```
Returns the total number of key-value pairs.  
- ```m``` map returned by map_Init.
---
### ```size_t map_Len(Map *m)```
Returns the current number of key-value pairs being used.  
- ```m``` map returned by map_Init.
---
### ```void map_Del(Map *m, const void *key)```
Removes the key and its value if the key is present.  
- ```m``` map returned by map_Init.
- ```key``` key to delete.
---
### ```void* map_Set(Map *m, const void *key)```
Inserts the key with a zero value if the key is not present.  
Returns NULL if the insert fails (map is full).  
Otherwise, returns a pointer to the key's value.  
- ```m``` map returned by map_Init.
- - ```key``` key to update or insert.
---
### ```const void* map_Get(Map *m, const void *key)```
Returns a pointer to the keyâ€™s value if the key is present.  
Otherwise, returns NULL (not in map).  
- ```m``` map returned by map_Init.
- ```key``` key to lookup.
---
### ```const void* map_Iter(Map *m, const void *key)```
Returns a pointer to the first key if the key is NULL.  
Returns NULL if the key was the last key.  
Otherwise, returns a pointer to the next key.  
- ```m``` map returned by map_Init.
- ```key``` current key iteration.
